I was given the code for building a neural network, as well as the code to run the playing of the game. What I was required to code was the Q-training algorithm to implement deep-Q learning. This was meant to find the best route to the treausre, while avoiding obstacles. 

Computer scientists are professionals that use technology to solve problems. They write and implement computer programs that can be used to help humans and computers interact with each other, as well as software for applications. 

As a computer scientist, I approach problems by looking at them as a whole, breaking them down into sections and deciding how best to tackle each section. This ensures that when I am done the entire problem is solved with no parts missed.

My ethical concerns in my field and to ensure that programs I write are not used for nefarious purposes or can be used in a way that is unethical or can bring harm to anyone. Whether this harm be financial, privacy related, or whatever.
